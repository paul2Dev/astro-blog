here is an easy way to setup your VueJS project with TailwindCSS.

## Step 1 â€“ install VueJS

first you need to install vue cli using npm, if you donâ€™t have it already.

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

after installation has finished you can check your version with this command:

```bash
vue --version
```

now letâ€™s create your vue project:

```bash
vue create project-name
```

the terminal will display some options, in this exemple iâ€™ve selected Vue 2

```bash
? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
  Default ([Vue 3] babel, eslint)
> Default ([Vue 2] babel, eslint)
  Manually select features
```

after installation has finished go to your project folder:

```bash
cd project-name
```

and then run server with npm command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

this will generate your local server on port 8080, you should see the link in your terminal. click on the link to view you VueJS app in browser.

## Step 2 -Install TailwindCSS

now letâ€™s install TailwindCSS to use it in your VueJS app. open your terminal in your VueJS app folder and run this command:

```bash
vue add tailwind
```

the terminal will display some options, in this exemple iâ€™ve selected minimal:

```bash
Successfully installed plugin: vue-cli-plugin-tailwind

? Generate tailwind.config.js 
  none
> minimal
  full
```

and that is it, tailwind is now ready to be used in your project.

## Step 3 â€“ import TailwindCSS in your VueJS app component

the last thing you have to do is to import tailwind in your app component:

open file ./src/App.vue and add this line in your <script>, your file should be look like this:

```javascript
<script>
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld.vue'
import './assets/tailwind.css'; //import tailwind css

export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    HelloWorld
  }
}
</script>
```

letâ€™s test it out by adding a html tag in our ./scr/App.vue file:

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <img alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
    <HelloWorld msg="Welcome to Your Vue.js App"/>
    <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white">
      test example tailwind
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

now run server again with npm run serve and you should see something like this:
